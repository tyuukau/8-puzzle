# Software Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the content of the `src/experiments` folder in the system. The folder is responsible for conducting various experiments and creating datasets from existing data. It contains several Python scripts that are used for different purposes.

## __init__.py

[__init__.py](src/experiments/__init__.py) is a file in the `src/experiments` folder. It is a special Python file that allows a directory to become a Python package from which modules can be imported.

## algorithm_exp.py

[algorithm_exp.py](src/experiments/algorithm_exp.py) is a Python script used to conduct experiments on different search algorithms and heuristics. It uses the pandas library to handle data, tqdm for progress bars, and multiprocessing for parallel processing. The script imports several classes and functions from other modules.

## exp_dataset.py

[exp_dataset.py](src/experiments/exp_dataset.py) is a Python script used to create an experimental dataset from existing data. It uses the pandas and numpy libraries to manipulate data and the warnings library to handle warnings.

## overestimation_exp.py

[overestimation_exp.py](src/experiments/overestimation_exp.py) is a Python script in the `src/experiments` folder. The file's specific functionality is not detailed in the provided JSON data.
