# __init__.py

## Overview
The `__init__.py` file is a special file in Python that allows a directory to become a Python package, meaning it can be imported just like a module. This file can be left empty or can execute initialization code for the package or set the `__all__` variable.

In this specific `__init__.py` file, we are importing several functions from two different modules, `modelling` and `inferring`. This allows the functions to be directly accessible when the package is imported.

## Code Description

### Import Statements
```python
from .modelling import train
from .inferring import infer, batch_infer, get_model
```
These lines are importing the `train` function from the `modelling` module, and the `infer`, `batch_infer`, and `get_model` functions from the `inferring` module.

## Functions

### train
This function is imported from the `modelling` module. It is used to train a model. The specific parameters and usage of this function would be detailed in the `modelling` module documentation.

### infer
This function is imported from the `inferring` module. It is used to make inferences or predictions using a trained model. The specific parameters and usage of this function would be detailed in the `inferring` module documentation.

### batch_infer
This function is also imported from the `inferring` module. It is used to make inferences or predictions on a batch of data using a trained model. The specific parameters and usage of this function would be detailed in the `inferring` module documentation.

### get_model
This function is imported from the `inferring` module. It is used to retrieve a trained model. The specific parameters and usage of this function would be detailed in the `inferring` module documentation.

## Conclusion
This `__init__.py` file is used to import several functions from the `modelling` and `inferring` modules, making them directly accessible when the package is imported. For more detailed information on the usage and parameters of these functions, refer to the documentation for the respective modules.
