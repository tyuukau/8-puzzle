# astar.py

This is a Python code file that implements the A* search algorithm. The A* algorithm is a popular choice in pathfinding and graph traversal, which is the process of finding a path between multiple points, called "nodes". It's widely used in applications such as maps, robotics, and AI.

## Class: AStar

The `AStar` class is a subclass of the `InformedSearchAlgorithm` class. It uses a heuristic function to guide its search.

### Initialization

The class is initialized with a heuristic function of type `CallableHeuristicClass`. This function is used to estimate the cost (distance, time, etc.) to reach the goal from a given node.

```python
astar = AStar(heuristic)
```

### Method: _search

The `_search` method is the core of the A* algorithm. It takes a `start_state` of type `State` as an argument and returns a `SearchResult` object.

```python
result = astar._search(start_state)
```

#### Parameters

- `start_state` (`State`): The initial state from which the search begins.

#### Return

- `SearchResult`: An object that contains the result of the search. It includes whether the search was successful (`result`), the path to the goal (`path`), the time complexity (`time_cp`), and the space complexity (`space_cp`).

### Method: _is_goal

This method checks if the current node is the goal. It's used internally by the `_search` method.

### Method: _reconstruct_path

This method is used to trace back the path from the start node to the goal node once the goal has been found. It's used internally by the `_search` method.

### Method: h_cost

This method calculates the heuristic cost from the current node to the goal. It's used internally by the `_search` method.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `AStar` class:

```python
# Define a heuristic function
def heuristic(node):
    # ... implementation ...

# Initialize the A* algorithm with the heuristic
astar = AStar(heuristic)

# Define the start state
start_state = State()

# Run the search
result = astar._search(start_state)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

## Note

The A* algorithm is an informed search algorithm, meaning it uses knowledge about the problem to guide its search. This is in contrast to uninformed search algorithms, which explore the search space without any guidance. The heuristic function is what provides this guidance in the A* algorithm. It's a function that estimates the cost to reach the goal from a given node. The better the heuristic, the more efficient the search.
