# game.py

This Python file, `game.py`, is a code file that contains the implementation of a game, specifically a puzzle game. The game is designed to be solved using a search algorithm. The file contains several classes, methods, and functions that are used to define the game, its configuration, and the process of solving it.

## Import Statements

The file begins with several import statements, importing necessary modules and classes for the game. These include `random`, `time`, `dataclasses`, `signal`, and several classes from the `algorithms` and `state` modules.

## ResultRecord Class

The `ResultRecord` class is a data class that represents the result of a search algorithm. It has five attributes: `path`, `path_length`, `time_cp`, `space_cp`, and `time`.

## TimeoutError Class

The `TimeoutError` class is a custom exception class that is raised when a function times out.

## timeout_handler Function

The `timeout_handler` function is a helper function that raises a `TimeoutError` when called. It is used to handle timeouts in the game.

## Game Class

The `Game` class represents an instance of the puzzle game. It has three attributes: `game_config`, `algorithm`, and `ignore_solvability`. The `game_config` attribute is an instance of the `GameConfig` class, which represents the configuration of the game. The `algorithm` attribute is an instance of the `SearchAlgorithm` class, which represents the search algorithm used to solve the game. The `ignore_solvability` attribute is a boolean that determines whether to ignore the solvability of the game.

The `Game` class has two methods: `_play` and `play`. The `_play` method is a private method that solves the game configuration using the given algorithm. The `play` method is a public method that starts the game, handles timeouts, and returns a `ResultRecord` object representing the result of the game.

## game_generator Function

The `game_generator` function is a helper function that generates a new game configuration for the puzzle game. It takes an optional argument `n`, which is the size of the puzzle, and returns a `GameConfig` object.

### Example Usage

```python
# Create a new game configuration
game_config = game_generator(n=4)

# Create a new game instance with the game configuration and a search algorithm
game = Game(game_config=game_config, algorithm=SearchAlgorithm())

# Play the game
result = game.play(do_print=True)
```

This will create a new 4x4 puzzle game, solve it using the specified search algorithm, and print the result.
